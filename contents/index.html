<h2>My favorite language is ... C#!</h2>

<p>
    My favorite language is C#. <br />
    (Although, each of programming languages takes advantage in different place and it is hard to compare them.)<br />
    Why my favorite language is C# is that I can read C# code easiler than anything else.
    If you haven't ever used C#, you should begin to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/">learn C#</a>.
