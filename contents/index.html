    My favorite language is C#. <br />
    Although, each of programming languages takes advantage in different place and it is hard to compare them.
    It's just that I can read C# code easiler than anything else.<br />
    After touching the name of this site, "new Capra() as IProgrammer",
    I think most C#er read it as "The instance of Capra is castable to IProgrammer, a interface" and then
    scream "I got it! It means that Capra314cabra wants to become a programmer!".
    That's right! That's why I selected this name.<br />
    (If you haven't ever used C#, you should begin to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/">learn C#</a>.)
